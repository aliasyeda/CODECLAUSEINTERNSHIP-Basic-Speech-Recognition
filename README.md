# CODECLAUSEINTERNSHIP-Basic-Speech-Recognition

🎙️ Speech Recognition System
Project by: codeclause Internship

This project demonstrates how to convert spoken language into written text using Python and the SpeechRecognition library. It listens to the user's voice using a microphone, processes it in real-time, and prints the recognized text.

## 📌 Project Objectives

To build a speech recognition system that captures audio via microphone

To convert spoken input into readable text using Google Speech API

To handle common errors in recognition, such as unclear audio or server issues

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used

Python 3

SpeechRecognition Library

PyAudio (for microphone input)

Google Speech-to-Text API (used through the library)

## 💡 How It Works

First, the speech recognizer tool is initialized

The program activates your device’s microphone

Once the user speaks, the audio is captured

The captured audio is sent to Google's recognition engine

The recognized text is printed on the screen

The system handles two common errors:

When speech is not understood

When there's an internet or API error

## ✅ Features

Real-time speech-to-text conversion

Simple and clear output

Error handling for unknown speech or network issues

Beginner-friendly and lightweight


## 🚀 Steps to Run

Install the required libraries: speechrecognition and pyaudio

Run the Python file

Speak into your microphone

Watch the text output appear in your terminal or notebook




## 📝 Notes

Make sure your microphone works properly

Requires internet connection to access Google API

Tested on Jupyter Notebook and standard Python environment
